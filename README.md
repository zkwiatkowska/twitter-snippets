# Daily Python snippets

This is a series I published regularly on Twitter with short Python snippets to learn about various Python functions. 

Snippets were published as images, but here they are stored in .py files. **In each file I added original Tweet as docstring with short explanation.** The repository will be updated as I continue with the series. 

Enjoy!
